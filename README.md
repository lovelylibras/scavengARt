# scavengARt

ScavengARt is an AR-based scavenger hunt that guides users through New York art museums, prompting them to follow a series of clues to discover selected artworks. Using ARKit image recognition and the userâ€™s camera view, scavengARt allows users to scan paintings around the museum. When the correct artwork is identified, a pop-up modal displays information and the app displays a 3D trophy on the artwork to indicate a successful guess.
We wrote the front-end of our application in Swift using XCode, ARKit, UIKit, and SceneKit. 

Our team is comprised of Ahsun Kim, Rachel Reinauer, and Audra Kenney.

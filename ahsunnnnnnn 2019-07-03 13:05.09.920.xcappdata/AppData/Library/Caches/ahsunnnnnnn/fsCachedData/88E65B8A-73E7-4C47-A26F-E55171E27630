Sargent hoped to enhance his reputation by painting and exhibiting her portrait. Working without a commission but with his sitter’s complicity, he emphasized her daring personal style, showing the right strap of her gown slipping from her shoulder. At the Salon of 1884, the portrait received more ridicule than praise. Sargent repainted the shoulder strap and kept the work for over thirty years. When, eventually, he sold it to the Metropolitan, he commented, “I suppose it is the best thing I have done,” but asked that the Museum disguise the sitter’s name.","museum":"Metropolitan Museum of Art","createdAt":"2019-07-03T05:01:20.159Z","updatedAt":"2019-07-03T05:01:20.159Z","huntId":1},{"id":2,"name":"Self-Portrait with a Straw Hat (obverse: The Potato Peeler)","artist":"Vincent van Gogh","imageUrl":"https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/436532/1671316/main-image","description":"Van Gogh produced more than twenty self-portraits during his Parisian sojourn (1886–88). Short of funds but determined nevertheless to hone his skills as a figure painter, he became his own best sitter: \"I purposely bought a good enough mirror to work from myself, for want of a model.\" This picture, which shows the artist's awareness of Neo-Impressionist technique and color theory, is one of several that are painted on the reverse of an earlier peasant study.","museum":"Metropolitan Museum of Art","createdAt":"2019-07-03T05:01:20.159Z","updatedAt":"2019-07-03T05:01:20.159Z","huntId":1},{"id":3,"name":"Springtime","artist":"Pierre-Auguste Cot","imageUrl":"https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/438158/799953/main-image","description":"This flirtatious duo in classicizing dress, painted with notable technical finesse, reflects Cot’s allegiance to the academic style of his teachers, including Bouguereau and Cabanel. Exhibited at the Salon of 1873, the picture was Cot’s greatest success, widely admired and copied in engravings, fans, porcelains, and tapestries. Its first owner, hardware tycoon John Wolfe, awarded the work a prime spot in his Manhattan mansion, where visitors delighted in \"this reveling pair of children, drunken with first love ... this Arcadian idyll, peppered with French spice.\" Wolfe’s cousin, Catharine Lorillard Wolfe, later commissioned a similar scene from Cot, The Storm, now also in the Metropolitan’s collection (87.15.134)","museum":"Metropolitan Museum of Art","createdAt":"2019-07-03T05:01:20.159Z","updatedAt":"2019-07-03T05:01:20.159Z","huntId":1},{"id":4,"name":"Bridge over a Pond of Water Lilies","artist":"Claude Monet","imageUrl":"https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/437127/796089/restricted","description":"In 1893, Monet, a passionate horticulturist, purchased land with a pond near his property in Giverny, intending to build something \"for the pleasure of the eye and also for motifs to paint.\" The result was his water-lily garden. In 1899, he began a series of eighteen views of the wooden footbridge over the pond, completing twelve paintings, including the present one, that summer. The vertical format of the picture, unusual in this series, gives prominence to the water lilies and their reflections on the pond.","museum":"Metropolitan Museum of Art","createdAt":"2019-07-03T05:01:20.160Z","updatedAt":"2019-07-03T05:01:20.160Z","huntId":1},{"id":5,"name":"Madonna and Child","artist":"Duccio di Buoninsegna","imageUrl":"https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/438754/794829/main-image","description":"This lyrical work inaugurates the grand tradition in Italian art of envisioning the sacred figures of the Madonna and Child in terms appropriated from real life. The Christ Child gently pushes away the veil of his mother, whose sorrowful expression reflects her foreknowledge of his crucifixion. The beautifully modeled drapery enhances their three-dimensional, physical presence and the parapet connects the fictive, sacred world of the painting with the temporal one of the viewer. The bottom edge of the original frame is marked by candle burns.","museum":"Metropolitan Museum of Art","createdAt":"2019-07-03T05:01:20.160Z","updatedAt":"2019-07-03T05:01:20.160Z","huntId":1},{"id":6,"name":"The Dance Class","artist":"Edgar Degas","imageUrl":"https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/438817/796418/main-image","description":"This work and its variant in the Musée d'Orsay, Paris, represent the most ambitious paintings Degas devoted to the theme of the dance. Some twenty-four women, ballerinas and their mothers, wait while a dancer executes an \"attitude\" for her examination. Jules Perrot, a famous ballet master, conducts the class. The imaginary scene is set in a rehearsal room in the old Paris Opéra, which had recently burned to the ground. On the wall beside the mirror, a poster for Rossini’s Guillaume Tell pays tribute to the singer Jean-Baptiste Faure, who commissioned the picture and lent it to the 1876 Impressionist exhibition.","museum":"Metropolitan Museum of Art","createdAt":"2019-07-03T05:01:20.160Z","updatedAt":"2019-07-03T05:01:20.160Z","huntId":1},{"id":7,"name":"Aristotle with a Bust of Homer","artist":"Rembrandt (Rembrandt van Rijn)","imageUrl":"https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/437394/1328682/main-image","description":"Among The Met’s most celebrated works of art, this painting conveys Rembrandt’s meditation on the meaning of fame. The richly clad Greek philosopher Aristotle (384–322 B.C.) rests his hand pensively on a bust of Homer, the epic poet who had attained literary immortality with his Iliad and Odyssey centuries before. Aristotle wears a gold medallion with a portrait of his powerful pupil, Alexander the Great; perhaps the philosopher is weighing his own worldly success against Homer’s timeless achievement. Although the work has come to be considered quintessentially Dutch, it was painted for a Sicilian patron at a moment when Rembrandt’s signature style, with its dark palette and almost sculptural buildup of paint, was beginning to fall out of fashion in Amsterdam.","museum":"Metropolitan Museum of Art","createdAt":"2019-07-03T05:01:20.161Z","updatedAt":"2019-07-03T05:01:20.161Z","huntId":1},{"id":8,"name":"The Storm","artist":"Pierre-Auguste Cot","imageUrl":"https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/435997/797712/main-image","description":"When Cot exhibited this painting at the Salon of 1880, critics speculated about the source of the subject. Some proposed the French novel Paul and Virginie by Bernardin de Saint-Pierre (1737–1814), in which the teenage protagonists run for shelter in a rainstorm, using the heroine’s overskirt as an impromptu umbrella; others suggested the romance Daphnis and Chloe by the ancient Greek writer Longus. New York collector and Metropolitan Museum benefactor Catharine Lorillard Wolfe commissioned the work under the guidance of her cousin John Wolfe, one of Cot's principal patrons. Like the artist’s earlier Springtime (2012.575), it was immensely popular and extensively reproduced.","museum":"Metropolitan Museum of Art","createdAt":"2019-07-03T05:01:20.161Z","updatedAt":"2019-07-03T05:01:20.161Z","huntId":1}]}

In what he called \"hand painted dream photographs,\" hard objects become inexplicably limp, time bends, and metal attracts ants like rotting flesh. The monstrous creature draped across the painting's center resembles the artist's own face in profile; its long eyelashes seem insectlike or even sexual, as does what may or may not be a tongue oozing from its nose like a fat snail.","museum":"Museum of Modern Art","createdAt":"2019-07-03T05:01:20.161Z","updatedAt":"2019-07-03T05:01:20.161Z","huntId":2},{"id":10,"name":"Drowning Girl","artist":"Roy Lichtenstein","imageUrl":"http://www.moma.org/media/W1siZiIsIjIzNzM1NSJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItcmVzaXplIDIwMDB4MjAwMFx1MDAzZSJdXQ.jpg?sha=02a005d35e63047d","description":"Lichtenstein based many of his early paintings on imagery he found in comic books. The source for this work is Run for Love! published by DC Comics in 1962, the cover of which the artist significantly altered to arrive at the finished composition. In the original illustration, the drowning girl’s boyfriend appears in the background, clinging to a capsized boat. Lichtenstein cropped the image dramatically, showing the girl alone and encircled by a threatening wave. He changed the caption from “I don’t care if I have a cramp!” to “I don’t care!” and the boyfriend’s name from Mal to Brad. In addition to appropriating comic books’ melodramatic content, Lichtenstein manually simulated the Benday dots used in the mechanical reproduction of images.","museum":"Museum of Modern Art","createdAt":"2019-07-03T05:01:20.162Z","updatedAt":"2019-07-03T05:01:20.162Z","huntId":2},{"id":11,"name":"The Starry Night","artist":"Vincent van Gogh","imageUrl":"http://www.moma.org/media/W1siZiIsIjEzMzA3NSJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItcmVzaXplIDIwMDB4MjAwMFx1MDAzZSJdXQ.jpg?sha=df9568c2c27b4c27","description":"\"This morning I saw the country from my window a long time before sunrise, with nothing but the morning star, which looked very big,\" van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo, from France. Rooted in imagination and memory, The Starry Night embodies an inner, subjective expression of van Gogh's response to nature. In thick, sweeping brushstrokes, a flamelike cypress unites the churning sky and the quiet village below. The village was partly invented, and the church spire evokes van Gogh's native land, the Netherlands.","museum":"Museum of Modern Art","createdAt":"2019-07-03T05:01:20.162Z","updatedAt":"2019-07-03T05:01:20.162Z","huntId":2},{"id":12,"name":"The Sleeping Gypsy","artist":"Henri Rousseau","imageUrl":"http://www.moma.org/media/W1siZiIsIjE1MTQzNCJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItcmVzaXplIDIwMDB4MjAwMFx1MDAzZSJdXQ.jpg?sha=ae96105416071a99","description":"Rousseau, a toll collector for the city of Paris, was largely a self-taught painter, although he had ambitions of entering the Academy. This was never realized, but the sharp colors, fantastic imagery, and precise outlines in his work—derived from the style and subject matter of popular print culture—struck a chord with a younger generation of avant-garde painters. Rousseau described the subject of The Sleeping Gypsy thus: \"A mandolin player, lies with her jar beside her (a vase with drinking water), overcome by fatigue in a deep sleep. A lion chances to pass by, picks up her scent yet does not devour her. There is a moonlight effect, very poetic.\"","museum":"Museum of Modern Art","createdAt":"2019-07-03T05:01:20.162Z","updatedAt":"2019-07-03T05:01:20.162Z","huntId":2},{"id":13,"name":"Campbell's Soup Cans","artist":"Andy Warhol","imageUrl":"http://www.moma.org/media/W1siZiIsIjMxODI0MiJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItcmVzaXplIDIwMDB4MjAwMFx1MDAzZSJdXQ.jpg?sha=269531510f1f9eb6","description":"When Warhol first exhibited these thirty-two canvases in 1962, each one simultaneously hung from the wall like a painting and rested on a shelf like groceries in a store. The number of canvases corresponds to the varieties of soup then sold by the Campbell Soup Company. Warhol assigned a different flavor to each painting, referring to a product list supplied by Campbell's. There is no evidence that Warhol envisioned the canvases in a particular sequence.","museum":"Museum of Modern Art","createdAt":"2019-07-03T05:01:20.162Z","updatedAt":"2019-07-03T05:01:20.162Z","huntId":2},{"id":14,"name":"Three Musicians","artist":"Pablo Picasso","imageUrl":"http://www.moma.org/media/W1siZiIsIjQzMDY2NCJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItcmVzaXplIDIwMDB4MjAwMFx1MDAzZSJdXQ.jpg?sha=aef88bb99e7d2597","description":"At the left of a bare and boxlike space, a masked Pierrot plays the clarinet. At the right, a singing monk holds sheet music. And in the center, strumming a guitar, is a Harlequin, in Picasso's art a recurring stand-in for the artist himself.\n      Pierrot and Harlequin are stock characters in the old Italian comic theater known as commedia dell'arte, a familiar theme in Picasso's work. The painting, then, has a whimsical side, epitomized by the near-invisible dog: its head is about halfway up the canvas on the left, one of several subtle browns, and we can also make out front paws, a hind leg, and a jaunty tail popping up between Harlequin's legs. Overall, though, the work's somber background and large size make the musicians a solemn, even majestic trio.\n      The intricate, jigsaw-puzzle-like composition sums up the Synthetic Cubist style, the flat planes of unshaded color recalling the cutout and pasted paper forms with which the style began. These overlapping shapes are at their most complex at the center of the picture, which is also where the lightest hues are concentrated, so that an aura of darkness surrounds a brighter center. Along with the frontal poses of the figures, this creates a feeling of gravity and monumentality, and gives Three Musicians a mysterious, otherworldly air.","museum":"Museum of Modern Art","createdAt":"2019-07-03T05:01:20.163Z","updatedAt":"2019-07-03T05:01:20.163Z","huntId":2}]}
